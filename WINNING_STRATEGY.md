## 🎬 Your Winning Pitch (4 Minutes)

### Opening (30 sec) - Hook
**Problem:**
"Researchers perform $2 billion worth of peer review annually... for free. Publishers profit while scientists struggle. Citation gaming is rampant. And most research is locked behind paywalls. We're here to fix that with blockchain."

### Solution (45 sec) - Innovation
**What we built:**
"We built the world's FIRST blockchain knowledge graph with on-chain external data verification. Using Flare's Data Connector, we verify papers against CrossRef before they hit the blockchain. Using Plasma, we pay researchers $100 in USDC the instant they submit a review. This has never been done before."

### Demo (90 sec) - Technical
**Live demonstration:**
1. Show live Vercel URL
2. Submit paper → highlight $50 USDC payment (Plasma)
3. Show Flare FDC verification request
4. Explain random reviewer assignment (Flare RNG)
5. Show $100 USDC review payment
6. Display stats dashboard

### Market (45 sec) - Commercial
**Opportunity:**
"The academic publishing market is $19 billion annually. We're addressing 100% of the $2 billion peer review market. Our path to adoption: partner with preprint servers like arXiv, offer a superior review layer, and gradually replace traditional publishers. The network effects are powerful - more papers create more value."

### Close (30 sec) - Call to Action
**Ask:**
"We're seeking the $10K investment to deploy on mainnet, partner with arXiv, and onboard our first 1,000 researchers. We've already built a working product in 48 hours. Imagine what we can do with resources and support. Thank you."

## 🎥 Demo Video Essentials

### Must-Have Shots:
1. **Landing page** - Beautiful, professional
2. **Connect wallet** - MetaMask integration
3. **Submit paper** - Show USDC payment via Plasma
4. **FDC verification** - Highlight "Verified via Flare FDC" badge
5. **Review panel** - Show $100 USDC reward
6. **Stats page** - Platform analytics
7. **Contract explorer** - Show real transactions on Flare

### Voice-Over Script:
```
"Academic publishing is broken. $2 billion in unpaid peer review.
We built the first blockchain knowledge graph with external data verification.

Watch as I submit a paper - paying $50 in USDC via Plasma's instant settlement.

Flare's Data Connector verifies this paper exists in CrossRef -
preventing fake papers from entering our system. This is impossible without Flare.

Reviewers earn $100 USDC the moment they submit - paid via Plasma.

When papers are cited, authors earn governance tokens.

This is live on Flare Coston2. Real contracts. Real verification. Real payments.

The future of research is decentralized."
```

## 🎤 If You Get to Judges Meeting

### Prepare for These Questions:

**Technical:**
- "How does the Flare Data Connector work?"
  → "FDC queries the CrossRef API to verify the paper's DOI exists and matches metadata. The oracle network reaches consensus and returns verified data on-chain."

- "Why not just use Chainlink?"
  → "Flare's FDC is enshrined in the protocol, lower cost, and designed for this exact use case. Plus FTSO and RNG are native."

- "What prevents Sybil attacks in reviews?"
  → "Reviewers must stake tokens, random assignment via Flare RNG, and reputation scoring with slashing for poor reviews."

**Business:**
- "How do you acquire users?"
  → "Partner with arXiv (20K papers/month), offer superior review layer, bootstrap with early adopter researchers."

- "What's your moat?"
  → "Network effects - more papers = more value. Token ecosystem locks in users. Flare FDC integration is hard to replicate."

- "Revenue model?"
  → "Submission fees ($50/paper × 3M/year = $150M TAM), 80% to reviewers, 20% to platform. Later: access fees, API licensing."

**Vision:**
- "Why will this win?"
  → "We solve a $2B problem with proven technology. We're FIRST to verify academic data on-chain. We have a working product, clear go-to-market, and massive TAM."
