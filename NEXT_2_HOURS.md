## 🎯 Goal: Submit to Main Track and Win $10K

**Deadline:** 2026/02/08 12:00
**Current Status:** ✅ Deployed to testnet, ✅ Live on Vercel

---

## ✅ Step-by-Step Action Plan

### 1. Update Vercel (5 minutes) - DO NOW

```bash
# Push the new testnet addresses to Vercel
git add -A
git commit -m "Update with Flare Coston2 testnet contracts"
git push
```

Then wait 2 minutes for Vercel to redeploy.

---

### 2. Test Live Demo (15 minutes)

**Visit:** https://knowledge-graph-delta.vercel.app

**Test Flow:**
- [ ] Page loads correctly
- [ ] Connect MetaMask
- [ ] Switch to Flare Coston2 network
- [ ] Get test USDC (from your deployed contract)
- [ ] Submit a test paper
- [ ] See "Verified via Flare FDC" badge
- [ ] Check stats page
- [ ] Take screenshots

**If anything doesn't work:**
- Check Vercel deployment status
- Check MetaMask is on Coston2
- Check contract addresses are correct

---

### 3. Record Demo Video (30 minutes) - CRITICAL

**Equipment:**
- Screen recording software (QuickTime on Mac, OBS, etc.)
- Good microphone (or clear voice)
- Your live Vercel URL

**Script to Follow:**
Use `docs/VIDEO_SCRIPT.md` OR record this:

**[0:00-0:30] Problem**
"Academic publishing is broken. Researchers do $2 billion of peer review for free. Citation gaming is rampant. Research is locked behind paywalls."

**[0:30-1:00] Solution**
"We built the first blockchain knowledge graph with external data verification. Using Flare's Data Connector and Plasma's payment rails."

**[1:00-2:30] Live Demo**
- Open https://knowledge-graph-delta.vercel.app
- Connect wallet
- Submit paper → show $50 USDC payment
- Show "Verified via Flare FDC"
- Show review panel → $100 USDC reward
- Show stats

**[2:30-3:00] Innovation**
"This is the FIRST time external academic data has been verified on-chain. Flare's FDC checks CrossRef. Plasma enables instant USDC payments. This is live on testnet."

**[3:00-3:30] Market & Close**
"$19 billion market. Clear path to adoption. Working product. Built at ETH Oxford 2026."

**Upload to YouTube:**
- Title: "Decentralized Research Graph - ETH Oxford 2026"
- Visibility: Unlisted (or Public)
- Copy the URL

### 5. Submit to DoraHacks (30 minutes)

**Go to:** https://dorahacks.io/hackathon/eth-oxford-2026

**Fill out form:**

**Project Name:**
```
Decentralized Research Graph
```

**Tagline:**
```
First blockchain knowledge graph with on-chain external data verification via Flare FDC and instant USDC payments via Plasma
```

**Description:**
```
Academic publishing is broken - $2B in unpaid peer review annually. We built the world's first blockchain-based knowledge graph where researchers actually get paid.

Our innovation: Using Flare's Data Connector (FDC), we verify papers against CrossRef before they hit the blockchain - preventing fake papers and citation gaming. Using Plasma, we pay reviewers $100 in USDC instantly upon submission.

This solves a real problem in a $19B market with proven technology. We're not just slides - we have a fully deployed, working demo on Flare Coston2 testnet.

Key Features:
• External data verification via Flare FDC (CrossRef API)
• Instant USDC payments via Plasma
• Random reviewer assignment via Flare RNG  
• Token rewards for citations and replications
• Dual token economy (USDC + governance)

Live demo: https://knowledge-graph-delta.vercel.app

**Tracks to Submit:**
✅ Main Track (select most relevant category)
✅ Flare Main Track
✅ Flare Bonus Track
✅ Plasma Track

**What makes this innovative:**
```
FIRST academic platform with on-chain external data verification. No one has used Flare's FDC for research verification before. Solving $2B unpaid peer review with instant Plasma stablecoin payments.
```

**Technical Highlights:**
```
- 5 smart contracts deployed on Flare Coston2
- Flare FDC integration for CrossRef API
- Flare FTSO for token pricing
- Flare RNG for fair reviewer assignment
- Plasma for USDC payment settlement
- Full-stack React + ethers.js frontend
- Multi-chain architecture
```

**Submit!**

### 6. Prepare for Judges (30 minutes)

**Practice your 4-minute pitch:**

1. **Hook** (30s): "$2B problem in academic publishing"
2. **Solution** (45s): "First on-chain data verification"
3. **Demo** (90s): Show live Vercel URL
4. **Market** (45s): "$19B opportunity"
5. **Close** (30s): "Working product, clear path"

**Prepare for Q&A:**
- How does FDC work? → "Queries CrossRef API, oracle consensus"
- Why Flare? → "Enshrined protocols, lower cost, RNG"
- Business model? → "$50 submission, $100 reviews, 20% platform fee"
- Go-to-market? → "Partner with arXiv, bootstrap researchers"
