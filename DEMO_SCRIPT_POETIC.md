# The Republic — A Demo in Seven Cantos
## ETH Oxford 2026 | Decentralised Research Verification
### *"To cook or to be cooked — that is the question"*

**Duration:** 4 minutes
**Dramatis Personae:** One presenter, one laptop, one dream of verified knowledge

---

## CANTO I: The Crisis
*After Shakespeare's Hamlet — "To be or not to be"*

> To replicate, or not to replicate — that is the question:
> Whether 'tis nobler in the lab to suffer
> The slings and arrows of outrageous p-values,
> Or to take arms against a sea of fraud,
> And by verifying, end it.
>
> Seventy percent of scientists have tried and failed
> to reproduce another's work. Papers published,
> never checked. We built The Republic —
> where Plato's castes meet Satoshi's chains.

**[Show landing page]** — Three tracks gleam like the three estates of the soul.

**[Click "Enter The Republic"]** — Connect thy wallet. The cave awaits.

## CANTO II: The Graph of All Knowledge
*After Milton's Paradise Lost — "Of Man's first disobedience"*

> Of papers first connected, and the fruit
> Of that forbidden graph, whose mortal links
> Brought citation into the World, and all our woe,
> With loss of ignorance — sing, Heavenly Muse.
>
> Behold: fifty papers, constellated —
> each node a star of human thought,
> each edge a lineage of ideas
> from attention mechanisms to the architecture of mind.

**[Pan the Knowledge Graph]** — Point to the constellations of science.

**[Search "attention"]** — Click the node. Show the paper sidebar.

> Every paper here is not mere text — it lives.
> It may be judged by markets, made to run as code,
> or handed to our agents for the trial of replication.

**[Click "Add"]** — Upload a PDF. Watch the node spawn in cyan fire and shrink to its true size, like a newborn star cooling into orbit.

## CANTO III: The Navigator
*After Dante's Inferno — "Nel mezzo del cammin"*

> Midway upon the journey of research,
> I found myself within a dark forest of papers,
> for the straightforward pathway had been lost.
> But then appeared a guide — not Virgil, but our Navigator —
> who searches by retrieval, answers by citation,
> and never hallucinates a number it hasn't earned.

**[Open Navigator sidebar]** — Ask: *"How did transformers change NLP?"*

> See how it speaks in measured prose, each claim
> a numbered stone laid upon the bridge of evidence.
> Click the small blue orb — the graph itself responds,
> zooming to the paper, proving what was said.

**[Click citation [1]]** — The graph obeys.

## CANTO IV: The Agents of Replication
*After Chaucer's Canterbury Tales — "Whan that Aprille"*

> Whan that the hackathon with its long houres
> Hath driven us to build with desperate powers,
> And AI agents, each of sundry caste,
> Set forth to judge if science's claims shall last —
>
> Then longen folk to replicate old papers,
> And specially, from every shire's researchers,
> To The Republic's Lab they wende,
> The holy verified truth to sende.
>
> First rides Dr. Iris, surveyor of all literature.
> Then Prof. Atlas, architect of experiment.
> Agent Tensor runs the simulation — while in parallel,
> Dr. Sage reviews with the severity of a thesis committee.
> Dr. Formal, most austere, writes Lean 4 proofs
> that sorry-mark what mortals cannot yet resolve.
> And lastly the Scribe, who binds the tale.

**[Select "Attention Is All You Need" → Click Run]**

> Watch the pipeline breathe. Each agent lights in turn —
> timers ticking like cathedral bells.

**[Scroll the ReplicationReport]** — Verdict, feasibility, formalisation.

## CANTO V: The Frontier and the Autonomous Loop
*After Shelley's Ozymandias — "Look on my works"*

> "My name is RALPH, Loop of Loops:
> Look on my discoveries, ye Mighty, and despair!"
> Nothing beside remains. Round the decay
> Of that colossal ignorance, boundless and bare,
> The lone and level frontiers stretch far away.
>
> Where Replication asks, "Is this true?"
> Discovery asks, "What truth remains unfound?"
> Select two papers. Three. Let the agents synthesise
> across their boundaries — finding gaps no human sought,
> hypotheses no mind alone could birth,
> connections that bridge biology to silicon.

**[Switch to Discover mode → Run]** — Show the Frontier Report.

**[Switch to RALPH]** — Click Start.

> And now the loop eternal: RALPH picks papers,
> runs the frontier, extracts queries,
> fetches new knowledge from the great libraries —
> OpenAlex, Semantic Scholar — scores each arrival,
> queues the worthy, discards the noise,
> and begins again. An engine of perpetual curiosity.

## CANTO VI: The Markets of Truth
*After Blake's Auguries of Innocence — "To see a World in a Grain of Sand"*

> To see a market in a grain of truth,
> And a probability in a wild hypothesis,
> Hold replication in the palm of your hand,
> And eternity in an LMSR curve.
>
> Every paper earns a prediction market.
> Will it replicate? The crowd bets with USDC.
> Flare oracles verify. Plasma settles.
> The price IS the probability —
> not what we hope is true, but what we'd wager.

**[Switch to Markets tab]** — Show the LMSR prices. Show Polymarket live.

> Here, money becomes epistemology.

## CANTO VII: The Full Circle
*After Tennyson's Ulysses — "To strive, to seek, to find"*

> Though much is built, much abides; and though
> We are not now that strength which in old days
> Moved heaven and earth at other hackathons,
> That which we are, we are —
> One equal temper of heroic hearts,
> Made weak by deadlines, but strong in will
> To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.
>
> Paper uploaded. Agents verify. Markets price.
> The graph connects. RALPH discovers what comes next.
> This is The Republic.

## EPILOGUE
*After Plato's Republic, Book VII — The Allegory of the Cave*

> "The task of the philosopher is to descend again into the cave
> and share what they have seen in the light."
>
> We built the light. Built on Flare and Plasma,
> at ETH Oxford, in the small hours.
>
> The Republic — decentralised research verification.
> Where truth is not decreed, but discovered,
> not published, but proven,
> not hoarded, but shared.
